# Activity-14

I created a program that gathers information from the user when they chose different choices given to them

1. The first one is the ListBox control, here the user choices a shirt design given to them. 

2. The second is the radio button, the user gets only one choice of color for their shirt.

3. The third is the check box, and here the user can either check the gift box, or the faster delivery box, or neither.

4. I then created a button for all those controls to be processed and then printed out the information that I gathered from the user.
